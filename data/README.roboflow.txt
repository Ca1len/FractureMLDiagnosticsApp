The dataset includes 1090 images.
Bone-fractures are annotated in YOLO v7 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -7 and +7 degrees
